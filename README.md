Android sample application to learn how to mix together sliding tabs and navigation drawer in the same activity.
Concept described in [Material Design - Side nav and tab combinations](https://material.io/guidelines/patterns/navigation.html#navigation-combined-patterns).
The idea is to mix default activities: tab activity with sliding menu activity.


Pre-requisites
